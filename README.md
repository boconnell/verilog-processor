Verilog Processor
=======

Class project for ENEE446.

Stage 1: Built an assembler in C and a sequential pipeline in Verilog

Stage 2: Built a pipelined RiSC-16, complete with data forwarding, simple branch prediction, and speculative execution (in Verilog).

Stage 3: Built a precise-interrupt facility into the pipeline, added support for memory management via a translation lookaside buffer (TLB), and, using RiSC-16 assembly code. ALso wrote a software TLB-miss handler.
